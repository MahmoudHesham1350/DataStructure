# Data Structures Assignment 

This repository contains solutions for the Data Structures Assignment from Cairo University's Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence.

## Assignment Overview

This assignment consists of five problems focusing on different data structures and algorithms:

1. **Iftar Invitation Manager**: An OOP system to manage guest invitations
2. **Polynomial Operations**: Implementation of polynomial operations using pointers
3. **Sorted Linked List**: A linked list that maintains elements in sorted order
4. **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementation of multiple sorting algorithms with visualization
5. **Statistical Calculation**: Program to perform various statistical operations

## Requirements

- C++ programming language
- No STL library usage allowed
- Proper memory management
- Efficient implementation

## Problem Descriptions

### Problem #1: Iftar Invitation Manager

This problem requires creating a system to track Iftar invitations, including:
- A `Guest` class to store information about each invitee
- An `IftarManager` class to manage multiple invitations
- Functions to add guests, display all guests, update a guest's invitation, and send reminders to all the guests
- Sorting guests by invitation date

### Problem #2: Polynomial Operations Using Pointers

Implementation of functions that dynamically allocate arrays to store polynomials and perform operations:
- Displaying polynomials in readable format
- Calculating the sum of two polynomials
- Calculating the difference between two polynomials

### Problem #3: Sorted Linked List

Implementation of a sorted linked list object that:
- Ensures that every newly element is inserted in its correct sorted position using insertion sort logic
- Supports element deletion at a specified index
- Implements overloaded operators (output and index)
- Ensures proper memory management

### Problem #4: Sorting Algorithms

A comprehensive sorting system that implements nine different sorting algorithms:
1. Insertion Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Bubble Sort
4. Shell Sort
5. Merge Sort
6. Quick Sort
7. Count Sort (integers only)
8. Radix Sort (integers only)
9. Bucket Sort

Features include:
- Interactive menu for algorithm selection
- Template-based implementation to support multiple data types
- Step-by-step visualization of the sorting process
- Performance tracking via execution time measurement

### Problem #5: Statistical Calculation

A program to calculate basic statistical values from a sequence of numbers:
- Median (middle value of sorted sequence)
- Minimum (smallest number)
- Maximum (largest number)
- Mean (average)
- Summation (total sum)
