## 📝 Problem Descriptions  

### 1️⃣ Iftar Invitation Manager  

A system to **manage guest invitations** using **OOP principles**:  
✅ `Guest` class to store invitee details  
✅ `IftarManager` class to handle multiple invitations  
✅ Functions to **add** guests, **display** all guests, **update** a guest's invitation, and **send** reminders to all the guests
✅ Sorting guests by **invitation date**  

### 2️⃣ Polynomial Operations Using Pointers  

Implementation of **dynamic polynomial operations**:  
🔹 Displaying polynomials in readable format  
🔹 Computing the **sum** and **difference** of polynomials  

### 3️⃣ Sorted Linked List  

A **linked list** that maintains elements in **sorted order**:  
🔹 **Insertion sort logic** for automatic ordering  
🔹 **Element deletion** by index  
🔹 **Operator overloading** for ease of use  
🔹 Ensures **proper memory management**  

### 4️⃣ Sorting Algorithms  

A system that implements **nine sorting algorithms** with **visualization**:  

| Algorithm  | Supported Data Types | Special Notes |
|------------|----------------------|---------------|
| 🟢 Insertion Sort | ✅ All types | Simple, efficient for small lists |
| 🟡 Selection Sort | ✅ All types | Finds the smallest element iteratively |
| 🔴 Bubble Sort | ✅ All types | Swaps adjacent elements iteratively |
| 🟣 Shell Sort | ✅ All types | Optimized version of insertion sort |
| 🔵 Merge Sort | ✅ All types | Divide and conquer approach |
| ⚫ Quick Sort | ✅ All types | Highly efficient |
| 🟠 Count Sort | 🔢 Integers only | Uses counting array |
| 🟤 Radix Sort | 🔢 Integers only | Sorts based on digit places |
| 🔶 Bucket Sort | 🔢 Floats/Integers | Uses multiple buckets |

🔹 **Interactive menu** for choosing an algorithm  
🔹 **Template-based implementation** for flexibility  
🔹 **Execution time measurement** for performance tracking  

### 5️⃣ Statistical Calculation  

A program to calculate **basic statistical values**:  
📉 **Median** – The middle value  
📈 **Maximum & Minimum** – Highest & lowest numbers  
➗ **Mean** – Average value  
➕ **Summation** – Total sum
